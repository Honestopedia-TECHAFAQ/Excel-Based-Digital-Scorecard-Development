# Excel-Based Digital Scorecard Development

## Overview

This project aims to develop a digital scorecard application using Python. The application allows users to upload an Excel file containing data and visualize the data through various plots and summary statistics.

## Features

* **Upload Excel File** : Users can upload an Excel file (.xlsx) containing their data.
* **Visualizations** : The application provides interactive visualizations including histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
* **Dynamic Column Selection** : Users can dynamically select columns from the uploaded Excel file for visualization.
* **Summary Statistics** : Summary statistics such as mean, median, and quartiles are displayed for the selected data.

## Technologies Used

* **Streamlit** : Used for building the web-based user interface.
* **Pandas** : Used for data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib** : Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
* **Seaborn** : Used for statistical data visualization.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the application using streamlit run main.py.
4. Upload an Excel file containing your data.
5. Select columns for visualization.
6. Explore the visualizations and summary statistics.

## File Structure

* **main.py** : Contains the main Streamlit application code.
* **requirements.txt** : Lists the required Python packages and their versions.
